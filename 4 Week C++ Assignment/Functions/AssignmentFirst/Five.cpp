// Ques:-> The minimum number of functions in any  C++ program is:
// Solution:->   1

// The main function itself.

//Ques:-> State True False
// A function may be called more than once from any other function. 

/*
Solution:->   TRUE
We can called as mny times a funciton as we want. it is necessary for a function to reutrn a value
*/

/*
Solution:-> FALSE
    A funciton can have a void return type, which means return nothing. Althrough it has to be cearly specified that the function is of void return type.
*/


/*
Question 7:-> Can the same funciton name be used for different functions without any conflict?

Solution:->     The same function name can be used for different function without any conflict if and only if they either have different data types for arguments or different number of arguments. Same function name cannot be used if functions differ only by thier return type because the compiler would not then know which function is to be used.
